# The-SquidCoder-Mod
 My First Minecraft Forge Mod. Feel free to use my code if you like it :)

What does this mod do?
- This mod is designed to be a sandbox for me to mess around in to learn how to make mods. Currently, I am backporting 1.17 to 1.16.5 for fun. If anyone knows how I can help with Blackgear27's version(https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/caves-and-cliffs-backport), PLEASE tell me as I would love to help.

Credit where credit is due:
-Thx to Kaupenjoe & SilentChaos512 for their AMAZING Forge modding tutorials.
-Thx to everyone who helps with the Create Mod for an amazing mod and great code to look at. (I plan to use their copper oxidation code as a start for my copper things).
-Thx to Mojang for obvious reasons.
